# Foundations Toolkit

A collection of small, practical projects used to build fundamentals in Python, Java, Linux, networking, and Git.

Primary environment: Fedora Linux.  
Each project is intentionally scoped, documented, and reproducible.

## Projects
1. [Log Parser (Python CLI)](log-parser-python)
2. [API Client CLI (Python CLI)](api-client-cli)
3. [File Organizer (Python CLI)](file-organizer)
4. [Network Diagnostics Toolkit (Bash)](network-diagnostics)
5. [Linux Hardening Script (Bash)](linux-hardening-script)

## Standards
- Every project folder includes a README with setup and usage examples
- Each Python tool will be installable as a CLI command via `pip install -e .`
- Scripts are written to run on Fedora, with MacOS compatibility later where reasonable
- Each milestone gets a Git tag and GitHub Release notes
